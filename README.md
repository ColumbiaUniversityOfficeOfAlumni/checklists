Drupal
------
If you see an error, either in drush or in dblog, that reads something like this:

> Error: require_once(): Failed opening required
> './sites/alumni.columbia.edu/modules/caa/sundialparser/SundialParser.inc'
> (include_path='.:/usr/local/Cellar/php53/5.3.29/lib/php') in
> /Volumes/drupal_root/sites/alumni.columbia.edu/modules/ctools/includes/plugins.inc, line 770

it is _not_ a problem with the Sundial module. I've never been able to figure out what is going on that causes that error; it might have something to do with PHP version, but I've never been able to prove it.
